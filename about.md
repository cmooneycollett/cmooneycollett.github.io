Hi, I'm Connor! I'm a cyber security professional with a passion for continued learning and sharing what I learn along the way.

My personal blog is my way of sharing my thoughts on interesting topics and what I've learnt through side projects.

Here are some of the topics I like to write about:
- Cyber security
- Software development: Rust and Python
- Professional development
- Personal development

My personal interests include running, English literature and spending time with my wife.
