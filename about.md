Hi, I'm Connor! I'm a cyber security professional with a passion for continued learning and sharing what I learn along the way.

My personal blog is my way of sharing my thoughts on interesting topics and what I've learnt through projects.

Here are some of the topics I like to write about:
- <b>Cyber security:</b> Operational Technology (OT), Critical Infrastructure (CI), InfoSec (IT)
- <b>Software development:</b> Rust and Python
- <b>Professional development:</b> Navigating career journeys
- <b>Personal development:</b> Resilience, healthy habits

My personal interests include running, English literature and spending time with my wife.
