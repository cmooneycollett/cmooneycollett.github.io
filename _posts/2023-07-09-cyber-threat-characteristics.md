Examining the behaviour of cyber threat actors leads to the intersection of human behaviour, technology, geopolitical tensions and many more facets of our modern world. Using a framework to characterise the behaviour of cyber threat actors can enhance your understanding of how to manage the cyber risks to your organisation and assets.

## The Framework

This framework of five characteristics is not an absolute or quantitative way to characterise cyber threat actors. 

The five characteristics can be qualitatively measured using levels such as High, Medium and Low - but this is flexible and can be adjusted based on the needs of your organisation.

Cyber threat actors can span different categories such as state-sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hacker-for-hire actors, hacktivists and insider threats.

The behaviour of cyber threat actors can be viewed through the lens of these five characteristics

- Capability
- Intent
- Resourcing
- Impact
- Tenacity

The benefit of utilising these characteristics is by enriching the technical measures of cyber threat actor behaviour (such as MITRE ATT&CK) with a lens of human behaviour and technology intertwined.

## Capability

**Capability** speaks to the degree of operational and technical sophistication possessed by a cyber threat actor.

The capability of a cyber threat actor may change over time. Low-capability threat actors can still pose a significant risk if they gain access to sensitive systems or information that asymmetrically enhances their effectiveness.

Tiers of capability:
- **High:** Threat actors at the high level of capability have extensive technical skills and operational sophistication, and they use advanced techniques to conduct their attacks. They are typically highly organised and have access to significant funding, infrastructure and data.
- **Medium:** Threat actors at the medium level of capability have a limited range of technical skills and resources, but they are still able to carry out moderately successful attacks. They may use less advanced techniques and may have less funding and infrastructure at their disposal, but they can still cause significant harm to their targets.
- **Low:** Threat actors at the low level of capability have limited technical skills and resources, and they are generally less capable of causing significant harm. They may use unsophisticated techniques and may not have access to significant funding or infrastructure.

## Intent

The **intent** of a cyber threat actor is their willingness to target a particular system or network.

+++

## Resourcing

The level of **resourcing** of a cyber threat actor is their degree of access to the various types of assets and supplies (such as financial, personnel, infrastructure and research/development) required to execute and support their operations.

+++

## Impact

The **impact** of a cyber threat actor is the severity of the harm that they may cause.

+++

## Tenacity

The **tenacity** of a cyber threat actor is their degree of persistence and determination to carry out attacks despite obstacles and resistance.
