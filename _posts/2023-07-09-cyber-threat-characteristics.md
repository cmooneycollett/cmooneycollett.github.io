Examining the behaviour of cyber threat actors leads to the intersection of human behaviour, technology, geopolitical tensions and many more facets of our modern world. Using a framework to characterise the behaviour of cyber threat actors can enhance your understanding of how to manage the cyber risks to your organisation and assets.

## The Framework

This framework of five characteristics is not an absolute or quantitative way to characterise cyber threat actors.

*But it is useful.*

The five characteristics can be qualitatively measured using levels such as High, Medium and Low - but this is flexible and can be adjusted based on the needs of your organisation.

Cyber threat actors can span different categories such as state-sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hacker-for-hire actors, hacktivists and insider threats.

The behaviour of cyber threat actors can be viewed through the lens of these five characteristics

- Capability
- Intent
- Resourcing
- Impact
- Tenacity

The benefit of utilising these characteristics is by enriching the technical measures of cyber threat actor behaviour (such as [MITRE ATT&CK][mitre-attack-url]{:target="_blank"}) with a lens of human behaviour and technology intertwined.

## Capability

**Capability** speaks to the degree of operational and technical sophistication possessed by a cyber threat actor.

The capability of a cyber threat actor may change over time. Low-capability threat actors can still pose a significant risk if they gain access to sensitive systems or information that asymmetrically enhances their effectiveness.

### Tiers of Capability

- **High:** Threat actors at the high level of capability have extensive technical skills and operational sophistication, and they use advanced techniques to conduct their attacks. They are typically highly organised and have access to significant funding, infrastructure and data.
- **Medium:** Threat actors at the medium level of capability have a limited range of technical skills and resources, but they are still able to carry out moderately successful attacks. They may use less advanced techniques and may have less funding and infrastructure at their disposal, but they can still cause significant harm to their targets.
- **Low:** Threat actors at the low level of capability have limited technical skills and resources, and they are generally less capable of causing significant harm. They may use unsophisticated techniques and may not have access to significant funding or infrastructure.

## Intent

The **intent** of a cyber threat actor is their willingness to target a particular system or network.

The distinction between High, Medium and Low intent cyber threat actors is not absolute and can change over time. The degree of intent of a threat actor may vary between targets within the scope of their broader strategic objectives. Furthermore, the motives and goals of cyber threat actors are not fixed quantities and are prone to change based on shifting circumstances or changes to their mission sets.

### Tiers of Intent

- **High:** High-intent actors have a clear and well-defined motive for their attacks, and they are often highly focused on achieving their objectives. These actors may be motivated by political, economic or military goals, or they may be seeking to cause widespread damage or disruption.
- **Medium:** Medium-intent actors may have a loosely defined or opportunistic motive for their attacks. These actors may not have a specific target in mind when they carry out an attack. Their primary goal may be to cause as much damage as possible or to steal as much valuable data as they can.
- **Low:** Low-intent actors have limited motivation or objectives for their attacks, and their attacks are often unsophisticated and poorly planned. These actors may be motivated by curiosity or a desire to prove themselves, or they may be testing the security of a target without any intention of causing harm.

## Resourcing

The level of **resourcing** of a cyber threat actor is their degree of access to the various types of assets and supplies (such as financial, personnel, infrastructure and research/development) required to execute and support their operations.

As with other characteristics, the distinction between High, Medium and Low resource cyber threat actors is not absolute. Threat actors can move between categories as their resources improve or degrade over time. Furthermore, threat actors with limited resources may still be capable of causing significant harm if they are highly skilled, have access to advanced technologies or privileged insider access.

### Tiers of Resourcing

- **High:** Highly resourced actors have substantial financial, technological and personnel resources available at their disposal, which they use to carry out their attacks effectively and efficiently. These actors may have large-scale operations with numerous employees, access to advanced technology, and significant funding to support their activities. They are typically well-equipped to conduct sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, and they may have a long-term agenda.
- **Medium:** Medium-resourced actors have access to a moderate level of financial, technological and personnel resources. These actors may be small groups or individuals who have limited access to funding, technology and personnel, but are still capable of conducting moderate-level attacks. They may use commercially available tools and techniques, and their attacks may be less sophisticated and less well-coordinated than those of highly resourced actors.
- **Low:** Low-resourced actors have limited financial, technological and personnel resources available to them. These actors may be individuals or small groups who are not well-equipped to carry out complex attacks and may rely on publicly available tools and techniques. Their attacks may be less sophisticated and less targeted than those of better resourced actors, and they may be more opportunistic in nature.

## Impact

The **impact** of a cyber threat actor is the severity of the harm that they may cause.

It is important to note that the impact of a cyber attack in first-order and higher-order effects can depend on many factors. Some of these factors include the specific system or network that has been attacked, the TTPs[^1] employed by the threat actor, the level of preparedness and resilience of the target, and the interconnectedness of the target with other systems.

### Tiers of Impact

- **High:** High impact cyber threat actors are those that can cause widespread harm and disruption. They may use advanced tactics such as zero-day exploits or malware that is difficult to detect and mitigate. The impact of a successful attack from a high impact actor could be devastating, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, or even physical harm.
- **Medium:** Medium impact cyber threat actors are less capable than high impact actors but still pose a significant risk. The impact of a successful attack from a medium impact actor could still result in significant financial loss but is less likely to cause widespread harm.
- **High:** Low impact cyber threat actors are those that have limited capability and resources. The impact of a successful attack from a low impact actor is likely to be relatively small but can still result in inconvenience or financial loss for the victims.

## Tenacity

The **tenacity** of a cyber threat actor is their degree of persistence and determination to carry out attacks despite obstacles and resistance.

Tenacity can vary greatly between cyber threat actors and can change over time. Some of the factors the factors that can influence the tenacity of a cyber threat actor include available resources, technical capabilities, their objectives for a particular attack campaign and the nature (e.g., targeted vs. broad) of their objectives.

### Tiers of Tenacity

- **High:** A high tenacity threat actor shows exceptional persistence and determination in carrying out their attacks, often adapting and evolving their methods to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.
- **Medium:** A medium tenacity cyber threat actor has a determined approach to their attacks but may be limited by certain constraints or face more difficulties in achieving their goals compared to high tenacity threat actors.
- **Low:** A low tenacity cyber threat actor may lack persistence and determination in carrying out their attacks, possibly giving up easily when faced with obstacles or resource constraints.
